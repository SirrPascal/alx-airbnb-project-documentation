# Flowchart – User Registration Process

This folder contains the flowchart for the **User Registration** process in the Airbnb Clone backend.  
It illustrates how a new user (Guest or Host) registers, how data is validated, and how the system handles verification and storage.

## Purpose
To visualize the steps and decision points involved in user registration — from data entry to email verification and account activation.

## Process Overview
1. User opens the registration page.  
2. Enters name, email, password, and role (Guest or Host).  
3. System validates input fields.  
4. Checks if the email already exists.  
5. If valid, password is hashed and user data stored in the database.  
6. A verification email is sent to the user.  
7. Once verified, the account is activated, and the user can log in.
